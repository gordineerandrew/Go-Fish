A list of everything that still needs to be completed for this project.

Scott NOTES

TO DO:
    Game Loop
        using order based on first to go
        Go clockwise
            Draw card IFF incorrect guess and deck isn't empty
            Else if deck empty and incorrect guess, do nothing
            else grab card from other player and make book
    Display Tweaks (To make more readable... Space between lines and adding a
            huge amount of whitespace after a turn to avoid clutter)
    *Optional* Add a name option for the human player
