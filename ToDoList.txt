A list of everything that still needs to be completed for this project.

Scott NOTES

* dealCards will need to be reworked a little bit. Not functionally, just design wise
because there is a bit of redundant code and you aren't checking for null returns from
drawCard()

* Minor minor minor change to chooseStartingPlayer. At the bottom where you pad the output
with an extra tab if it is the human player (so that the roll outcomes line up), I think
it would be a good idea to go even further with that and generalize it to any name within
a certain size instead of hardcoding each name as 1 or 2 tab characters. I can't remember
exactly how to do it, but I know that there is printf functionality that allows you to specificy
how many characters a chunk of your output can take up.

* Inside of gameloop it would be a good idea to get rid of the for loop. Using a for loop
adds an unnecessary conditional check that we don't need. I think simply using a modulus
and continually incrementing some kind of player count would be simpler and work really
well with the native array implementation that you have. Also it looks like you are using
the Arraylist get() more than is necessary. We should 'cache' the current player within
some kind of variable to keep from doing unnecessary work

TO DO:
    Game Loop
        using order based on first to go
        Go clockwise
            Draw card IFF incorrect guess and deck isn't empty
            Else if deck empty and incorrect guess, do nothing
            else grab card from other player and make book
    Display Tweaks (To make more readable... Space between lines and adding a
            huge amount of whitespace after a turn to avoid clutter)
    *Optional* Add a name option for the human player
